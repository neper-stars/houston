screenshots show the definitions of each zip order for the hobbit player (player 0)

year 1:
  
  - the ziporder data should only be visible in the order file .x1
    as the zip orders are just being defined but the turn has not been
    generated

year 2:

  - the ziporder data should now be in the game file .m1 and maybe in the
    history file .h1 ...
