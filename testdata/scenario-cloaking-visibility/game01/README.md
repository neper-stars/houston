The test data begins at turn 2430:

  - Turn 2430: Player 1's fleet "Smaugarian Peeping Tom #7" is coming into
    the "perceived" scanning range of Player 2's starbase.
    Player 2 could think he would see us and be safe...
    but in reality Player 2 does NOT see "Smaugarian Peeping Tom #7" yet
  - Turn 2431: Player 2 does NOT see "Smaugarian Peeping Tom #7"
  - Turn 2432: Player 2 does NOT see us
  - Turn 2433: same
  - Turn 2435: same
  - Turn 2435: Player 2 finally sees "Smaugarian Peeping Tom #7" !!
